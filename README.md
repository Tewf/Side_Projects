# ðŸ’¡ Side Projects & Creative Experiments

Welcome! This repository is a collection of small, experimental, or just-for-fun projects I build when inspiration strikes â€” whether itâ€™s out of boredom, curiosity, or the need to explore an idea.  
While not always polished or complete, they represent creative freedom and technical exploration outside of formal academic or professional work.  

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer

These are informal and often work-in-progress. Don't expect production-ready software â€” the goal is exploration and learning. Feedback and ideas are always welcome!
